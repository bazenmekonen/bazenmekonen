Hello there, I am Bazen Mekonen! 

![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=bazenmekonen&layout=compact&theme=dark)

I am just a curious guy who needs to know the answers to my questions. When I'm not trying to figure out answers in my code, I am typically reading/listening to philosophy, hitting the gym, or trying to learn a new language(Count:2)
